Property Price Evaluation in Andalusia and Malaga"

This project focuses on analyzing property prices in Andalusia and Malaga, utilizing data from reliable sources such as the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE) and notariado.org.
The analysis covers apartment prices in both, as well as average salary data for Andalusia. Many news reports suggest that current apartment prices have surpassed those seen during the 2007 
real estate bubble ("burbuja inmobiliaria").

The project examines property price trends from 2008 to 2023, evaluating how they have evolved over time. Additionally, it investigates the affordability of buying property for an average Andalusian resident,
exploring whether there have been any significant changes in affordability over the last 15 years. This analysis aims to provide insights into the current housing market and how it compares to historical trends,
particularly in the context of rising prices and wage growth.
